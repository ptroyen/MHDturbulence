## Set the forcing type, wavenumber, helicity and energy input rate
## type = 1 negative damping
## type = 2 adjustable helicity forcing

## set output prefix
OUTPUT	testing.

## Set how regularly to backup (in hours)
BACKUP_INTERVAL	0.00

## Set the initial kinetic helicity. This needs to be a value in [-1,1] as it is the 
## ratio between helicity and energy spectrum/wavenumber. 1 and -1 produce a maximally helical field.
